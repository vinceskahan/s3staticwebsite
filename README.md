## attempt to create a s3-hosted static website via AWS CLI

This is based on the manual steps at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html

If I follow the 'manual' procedure, the static website works as expected.

If I use this script, browsers want to 'download' the files, rather than 'interpreting' them.  Why ?
